# Selection in ##Platform_Name## Treegrid control

Selection provides an option to highlight a row or a cell. It can be done through simple mouse down or arrow keys. To disable selection in TreeGrid, set the [`allowSelection`](../../api/treegrid/#allowselection) to false.

The treegrid supports two types of selection that can be set by using the [`selectionSettings.type`](../../api/treegrid/selectionSettingsModel/#type). They are:

* **`Single`**: The `Single` value is set by default, and it only allows selection of a single row or a cell.
* **`Multiple`**: Allows you to select multiple rows or cells.
To perform the multi-selection, press and hold CTRL key and click the desired rows or cells. To select range of rows or cells, press and hold the SHIFT key and click the rows or cells.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/selection-cs8/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/selection-cs8/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% include code-snippet/treegrid/selection-cs8/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treegrid/selection-cs8" %}
{% endif %}

## Selection mode

TreeGrid supports three types of selection mode which can be set by using
[`selectionSettings.mode`](../../api/treegrid/selectionSettings/#mode). They are:

* **`Row`** - The `row` value is set by default. Allows you to select rows only.
* **`Cell`** - Allows you to select cells only.
* **`Both`** - Allows you to select rows and cells at the same time.

## Touch interaction

When you tap a treegrid row on touchscreen device, the tapped row is selected.
It also shows a popup ![Multi Row selection](images/selection.jpg)  for multi-row selection.
To select multiple rows or cells, tap the popup![Multi Row or Cells](images/mselection.jpg)  and then tap the desired rows or cells.

> Multi-selection requires the selection [`type`](../../api/treegrid/selectionSettings/#type) to be `multiple`.

The following screenshot represents a treegrid touch selection in the device.
