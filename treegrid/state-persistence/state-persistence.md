# State persistence in ##Platform_Name## Treegrid control

State persistence refers to the TreeGrid's state maintained in the browser's [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser.
State persistence stores treegridâ€™s model object in the local storage when the [`enablePersistence`](../../api/treegrid/#enablepersistence) is defined as true.
