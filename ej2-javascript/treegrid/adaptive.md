# Adaptive in ##Platform_Name## Treegrid control

The Tree Grid user interface (UI) was redesigned to provide an optimal viewing experience and improve usability on small screens. This interface will render the filter, edit dialog and other features adaptively. For example, Filtering opens the UI for user in a pop-up occupying the entire screen.

To make the tree grid adaptive, set the [`enableAdaptiveUI`](../api/treegrid/#enableAdaptiveUI) to true.
